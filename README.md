# robotics_interview_prep

Practice questions and answers that helped me prepare for job interviews with robotics companies.

This repository contains practice questions and answers for the different areas of expertise that are usually tested during a job interview with a robotics company:

* [Robotics](robotics.md)
* [Algorithms](algorithms.md)
* [Data structures](data_structures.md)
* [C++](c++.md)

Since I am specialized in [mapping and localization](mapping_localization.md), I also included a lot of questions and answers about that topic.

Of course, these questions are not meant to constitute a complete catalogue of everything you could possibly be asked during an interview.
But they worked well for me, and I hope they will be helpful for your preparation, too!

In case you have additions or corrections, please open a pull request.
